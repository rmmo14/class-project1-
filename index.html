Now with sqrt2=p:q, squaring both sides will give 2=(p:q)^(2), moving over the q gives 2q^(2)=p^(2). This implies p^(2) is even and thus p is even of the form p=2k, where k is an integer. By substitution then 2q^(2)=p^(2)=(2k)^(2) which gives q^(2)=2k^(2). This implies q^(2) is even and thus q is even. BUT, this contradicts the fact that gcd(p,q)=1, therefore sqrt2 is not rational.

                Many students open a book and feel intimidated by the 
                various letters, mathematical operations, and verbiage of theorems
                and proofs. Though many times students have applied and worked
                with what they are reading, they do not understand the language 
                used. Go to the examples and justify each step of the problem. Understand how they got to each step...

                Mathematics is a craft, and with any craft you must practice 
                to perfect it. It will not be easy and at times you may be frustrated by 
                the number of times you have to restart your problem because of
                a minimal mistake. BUT you must perserve! Learn from your mistakes to ensure you do not
                repeat it, and you understand why it doesn't work. Each "mistake" is a learning opportunity, maybe one that you will never forget.

                Many problems follow a certain structure. If you practice enough
                and often, you will notice those patterns that will get you to a solution much faster. 
                You will also notice shortcuts you can take because of the logical reasoning that goes behind it. 
                Also, by adding more and more problems to your memory and experience, then you will
                be better equipped with more strategies.
